= tinypad: a tiny Notepad/textpad style editor in Java

Well, it all fits in one source file, so you know it isn't going to displace TextPad or NotePad++.
Not to mention Emacs.

Currently offers a single-window text edit function, with undo/redo capability.

== Origins

Bits of this code are adapted from an earlier editor ("EzEditor") used in the GUI chapter of
https://learningtree.com/471[Learning Tree's Introductory Java Course].
My version is quite a bit more fully fleshed out, and significantly modernized.

The icons are from

. https://findicons.com/
. the _Java Look and Feel Guidelines_ download file _jlfgr.jar_.

As with all free software, use at own risk.
